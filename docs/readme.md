<h1>Important notes</h1>
<p>Most of the examples that I have followed are from various sources such as Linkedin Learning, or the Mozilla MDN. My independent projects are my own idea. I only use AI tools for bug-fixing (CodeSnack IDE), and, code-snippets/assists. While I am coding, I have found typically that AI is not correct all the time and I should not rely on it. That said, there are various tools such as AWS's Whispersync, that are really useful doing line by line, and, for predictive purposes. </p>

<p>I am an aspiring developer, with knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, some PHP, and I wish to expand those skills. I have strong expertise in CSS3, HTML, Responsive Design, and Accessibility. I also keep up with the latest coding languages and trends, such as AI, like I mentioned. While AI might point you in the right direction, I am not sure that there's a one-size-fits-all solution. You need a human to also really look at the code and make sure that it's right.
