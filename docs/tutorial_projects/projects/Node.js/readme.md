<h1>Readme</h1>
<p>I was doing a series of projects that were introducing me to the language of nodejs, ejs, using what I know about CSS and Javascript. Focusing more on the backend, I was working more on making sure that everything worked the way that I planned it. The Udemy tutorial had us use the open weather API, EJS, and other techniques. </p.>
