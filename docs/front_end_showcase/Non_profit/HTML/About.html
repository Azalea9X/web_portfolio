  <h1>How we can help</h1>
<p>We have people actively staying in touch with veterans. As we have a number of military veterans ourselves, we know how serious it is that people get treated, and, what can happen when things do not get treated. PTSD is <a href="https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental-health/ptsd/related/ptsd-statistics/">a very serious issue, and, not scoffed at.</a> People think that PTSD is something that just occurs to veterans, which, it can happen as a result of the violence they encounter, but, it can also happen to vulnerable people, such as women, who experience sexual assault, and have experienced it in the military. 71% of women begin the onset of PTSD as a result of the things they endure while in the armed forces.</p>

<p>We offer services such as counseling, which, can be used as a means to treat former service members. We want to make sure that everyone feels welcomed and that when people watch news events, that they can watch it in piece, knowing that the war is over, and, they can relax. It's not easy to turn this off. But, we want to be a part of the solution for this. This is what we were meant for.</p>
