<h1>Who we are</h1>
<h2>We help veterans first, allies alike.</h2>

<p>Take this <a href="./join.html">short quiz</a> to figure out whether or not you have symptoms of PTSD!</p> 
<p>If you feel like you have more than a few of them, you should go to a doctor and talk to them, first, then, talk to us once you have an official diagnosis. We know that you cherish memories like these and that transitioning is really tough. We want to be here for you. </p>
