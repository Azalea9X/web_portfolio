  <h1>Welcome to the pro-PTSD-initiative</h1>
  <p>Hi. We are a non-profit organization geared to helping out veterans with PTSD. We are saddened when we hear either members of the armed forces, or, various branches of service, such as members of the Capitol Police. Anyone who has ever served in an organization that has dealt with different types of conflict are who we want to help. </p>

  <p>On our website, we have more information that you can learn about us with, we have our own signup form, that you can quiz yourself so that you can see if you think you have PTSD, if you need to talk to a doctor, and, we have a signup form where you can learn more information from us.</p>

  <p>Just as a disclaimer, we understand that PTSD can be triggered by anything and that it is no laughing matter. Therefore, we will make our website fully accessible, and, we will not overwhelm you with things that you do not need to focus on. Everything will be by the book, as they call it.</p>
