<p>These are a work in progress. To run the various apps, you need to have a local MySQL server already set up and running. It doesn't matter which browser that you run it in. Once you get that running, you change the variable names in the .env files which I have not sent out, due to privacy concerns. I demonstrate a simple use of CORS to access the MySQL server.</p>

<p>You can use either node or nodemon to run the files. No special packages other than what's included will already be run. Just do a basic npm i or yarn add and that will get the most basic setup done.</p> 

<p>I am able to perform the CRUD, but, I seeem to have an issue with performing the U and the D in the browser. These two examples are working applications, in a very basic form. I want to focus on getting the update and delete statement to work in the browser before moving on. </p>
